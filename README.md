## Development

The site is developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  All the
development dependencies, including Jekyll, can be installed with the
`bundle` command.

The development server can be run using the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

It will, by default, register on http://localhost:4000.
